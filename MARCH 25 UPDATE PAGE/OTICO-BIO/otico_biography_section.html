                I am <strong>Gabriel N. Otico</strong>, born on June 20, 2004, at <strong>Angono Medics Hospital</strong>. The <em>youngest of five siblings</em>, I grew up facing health challenges due to asthma<sup>1</sup>. Despite these difficulties, my childhood was filled with unique experiences that shaped my perspective on life<sup>2</sup>. From a young age, my weak immune system led to frequent hospitalizations for asthma-related issues<sup>3</sup>. This not
                only affected my physical activities but also limited my interactions with others<sup>4</sup>. I often found myself indoors, playing alone or occasionally with neighborhood friends<sup>5</sup>. The struggle to breathe during physical activities made me envy other children who could play without worry<sup>6</sup>. The isolation and limitations sometimes
                made me feel lonely, especially when comparing my experiences to those of other kids<sup>7</sup>. However, I
                discovered solace in the simple joys of being at home<sup>8</sup>. Playing with my parents and siblings became a source
                of happiness, teaching me that <em>connection and love</em> could triumph over physical limitations<sup>9</sup>. Looking back, I
                realize the financial strain my health placed on my family<sup>10</sup>. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="information">
                Hospital bills were a burden, and I vividly remember my parents searching for ways to cover these expenses<sup>11</sup>. Despite our limited resources, they went to great lengths, even seeking help from others to ensure I received the medical care I needed<sup>12</sup>. I idolized my parents during those challenging times<sup>13</sup>. Their unwavering support and sacrifices became evident as they worked tirelessly to provide for my needs<sup>14</sup>. I remember the comfort they brought me, especially through my favorite indulgence, Jollibee, which became a symbol of love and care during those difficult days<sup>15</sup>. My childhood was a mix of <em>challenges and heartwarming moments</em><sup>16</sup>. While health issues created hurdles, the love and support of my family became the foundation of my resilience<sup>17</sup>. Today, I cherish those early experiences, recognizing the strength and unity that emerged from overcoming adversity<sup>18</sup>. These trials not only shaped my character but also instilled in me a profound appreciation for the intangible riches of life – the warmth of family bonds, the enduring power of love, and the importance of resilience in the face of adversity<sup>19</sup>. As I
                navigate through life, the lessons learned in those formative years continue to guide me, reminding me of the invaluable treasures found in the midst of struggle and the unwavering strength that family provides<sup>20</sup>.<br><br>

              As I entered my teenage years, a pivotal period of <strong>self-discovery</strong> and <strong>growth</strong>, I found myself focusing on academics<sup>1</sup>. High school became a significant chapter marked by challenges, determination, and unexpected opportunities<sup>2</sup>. During high school, I faced criticism from the parents of my classmates who belittled my academic abilities<sup>3</sup>. Determined to prove them wrong, I committed myself to rigorous studying for every quiz and examination<sup>4</sup>. Through hard work and perseverance, I not only met but exceeded expectations, achieving high scores in various subjects<sup>5</sup>. My high school days are etched in my memory as a time of self-discovery and resilience<sup>6</sup>.  
              Despite the academic challenges, I cherished the friendships formed during this time<sup>7</sup>. I had a circle of friends with whom I could share dreams and aspirations<sup>8</sup>. Together, we navigated the complexities of adolescence, supporting each other through shared experiences<sup>9</sup>. An unexpected opportunity arose when an application for a C.A.T Officer opened from Grade 8 to Grade 10<sup>10</sup>.

          <p class="information">
              Despite initial skepticism from classmates due to perceived physical limitations, I decided to challenge myself<sup>11</sup>. Joining turned out to be the best decision of my life, proving to myself and others that strength comes in various forms<sup>12</sup>. This experience became a turning point, marking my transition from the perceived 'weak kid' to a capable individual<sup>13</sup>.  Transitioning to senior high school coincided with the onset of the pandemic<sup>14</sup>. Adapting to a new setup at STI Ortigas-Cainta Branch under the ICT strand presented unique challenges, particularly in connecting with classmates through online meetings<sup>15</sup>. Despite the initial difficulties, I found myself elected as a <strong>class president</strong><sup>16</sup>. This role, though unfamiliar, became a platform for <em>personal growth</em>, <em>honing my communication skills</em>, and teaching me <em>valuable leadership lessons</em><sup>17</sup>.  Reflecting on my teenage years, I see a journey marked by <strong>resilience</strong>, <strong>personal growth</strong>, and the <strong>determination to overcome challenges</strong><sup>18</sup>. Academic triumphs, unexpected leadership roles, and enduring friendships have shaped my identity and prepared me for the next chapters of life<sup>19</sup>. As I move forward, I carry with me the lessons learned during these formative years, grateful for the strength and resilience that emerged from each experience<sup>20</sup>. <br><br>
